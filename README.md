# LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_ipynb
📝 Key Highlights:-

📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed detailed univariate & bivariate analysis.
Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to detect patterns & outliers.
Handled missing values and checked data distribution.

📉 2. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Analysis:
Computed VIF scores to detect multicollinearity.
Removed highly correlated features to improve model stability.

🔢 3. Logistic Regression Model Creation:
Split dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained a Logistic Regression model using sklearn.
Evaluated performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve.
Fine-tuned model parameters for better predictions.
